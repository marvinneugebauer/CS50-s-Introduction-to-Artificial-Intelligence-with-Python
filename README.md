#  Discription of the Projects

- **Project: Degrees**
    +  For two sets of CSV data files, where each file contains the same names, and the same structure, weâ€™re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. Therefore we are using the **breadth-first search algorithm** in degrees.py.
- **Project: Tictactoe**
    + Using the **Minimax algorithm**, implement an AI in tictactoe.py to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
- **Project: Knights**
    + Determine how to represent  Knights and Knaves puzzles using propositional logic, such that an AI running a model-checking algorithm could solve these puzzles for us. The implemenation of that problem can be found in
