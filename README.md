#  Discription of the Projects

- **Project: Degrees**
    +  For two sets of CSV data files, where each file contains the same names, and the same structure, weâ€™re interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. Therefore we are using the **breadth-first search algorithm** in degrees.py.
- **Project: Tictactoe**
    + Using the **Minimax algorithm**, implement an AI to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.
